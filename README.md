# My Simple Python Portfolio Website

This is a small portfolio website created while learning Python and Streamlit.  
The goal of this project is to practice basic Python skills and build a simple
web-based portfolio that shows my education, projects, skills, and interests.

- **About Me** – education and background  
- **Projects** – class projects from networking and Linux

Everything is built using only Python with Streamlit.  
No HTML or CSS was used.
